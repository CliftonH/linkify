ACTIONSCRIPT

You may either:
  1) Copy the swc into a local folder (e.g. the /libs directory in a Flex project) and change the project properties to include linkify.swc in the build process
  2) Include the source code directly.  If you include the source directly, you must make sure to include the folder structure as well (e.g. you may have a folder <project_name>/libs/com/hipchat/Link.as)

Please note, if you wish to include the emoticonify functionality, you will need to edit the source code to link emoticons to the correct place.  See the emoticonText function in Link.as.
